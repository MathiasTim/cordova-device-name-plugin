# cordova-device-name-plugin

This plugin returns the device name.

On iOS this is the name the user has given his/her device under Settings > General > About > Name.

On Android it is a combination of the device model and the manufacturer, since you would need 'Bluetooth Permissons' to display the device name the user can set.

## Installation
```
  $ cordova plugin add https://github.com/MathiasTim/cordova-device-name-plugin.git
```
